# BHAS master node

ESP32 firmware of a master node for my Bio Home Automation System (BHAS - pronounced BeeHas).

The master node connects multiple nodes via CAN to MQTT.

## Notes

Do note that CAN is called TWAI. [More info @ Two-Wire Automotive Interface](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/twai.html).
